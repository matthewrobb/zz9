Contributing will be easier once there is at least a minimum viable product. Right now, there aren't even any tests. Still, pull requests are welcome and appreciated.

## Want something in the meantime
Take a look at [sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr), [sickrage](https://github.com/SiCKRAGETV/SickRage), [sickbeard](https://github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard).

You probably want sonarr. It's pretty great. If for some reason you don't want to use that you may want to avoid sickbeard. It's no longer maintained. Sickrage is sickbeard, but maintained and with more features.

## Why something else?
First off, personal preference. I want something in node and javascript. I like writing javascript and I think it will be easier for other people to contribute to. I've used sickbeard for years, but the project seems to have been abandoned. Sonarr is great, but it's pretty slow once you have a lot of shows, even on beefy linux hardware. Might be mono's fault, but still, it's a pain. Finally, I want something modern through and through. zz9 is built on node with hapi and react in ES6.
